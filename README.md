# ocr-with-benefits
OCR based on Google services with some sweets  

I know that can be confusing, especially setting up the project, so
don't hesitate to contact me for any related questions

This project is based on the Google Cloud Platform API,  
including: *Cloud Document AI API* and *Cloud Translation API*  
Don't forget to enable them in your project console

Also you need to install some Python packages,  
including: *google-api-core*, *google-cloud-translate* etc.,  

To resolve dependencies use:  
```Python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

To run this program, setup variables and after simply use:  
```Python
python3 main.py
```
